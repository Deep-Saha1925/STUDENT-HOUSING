## 📌 Overview

**Student Housing Management System** is a web-based platform built using **Java Spring Boot, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, and PostgreSQL (Neon)**. It enables **students** to search for and book rental properties, **owners** to list, manage, and rent out their properties, and **admins** to manage users and maintain platform integrity.

> No extra app install needed. Works in any browser. Designed for students and property owners alike. Data is stored in the cloud via Neon PostgreSQL — accessible from any machine.

## 🎨 UI Design System

All pages share a consistent design system using CSS variables, supporting seamless light/dark theme switching. Theme preference is saved in `localStorage` under the key `sh-theme`.

### Color Palette

| Variable | Light Mode | Dark Mode |
|---|---|---|
| `--accent` | `#FF5E62` | `#FF5E62` |
| `--accent-2` | `#FF9966` | `#FF9966` |
| `--bg` | `#FAF7F4` | `#111112` |
| `--card-bg` | `#FFFFFF` | `#1E1E22` |
| `--text` | `#1A1A1A` | `#F0EDE8` |
| `--text-muted` | `#777777` | `#888888` |
| `--input-bg` | `#F5F2EF` | `#26252A` |

## ⚙️ Implementation Details

### 1️⃣ Authentication & Authorization

- Spring Security used for **login, logout, and role-based access control**
- Roles: `ROLE_STUDENT`, `ROLE_OWNER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`
- Custom `LoginSuccessHandler` redirects each role to their respective dashboard on login
- Unauthorized access to protected routes redirects to `/access-denied` instead of the default Whitelabel 403 error
- A separate `UnauthorizedActionException` + `GlobalExceptionHandler` catches ownership-mismatch actions (e.g. an owner trying to view another owner's bookings) and renders a themed **"Unauthorized"** page instead of a raw stack trace

### 2️⃣ File Storage

- Images uploaded to **Cloudinary**
- When properties are deleted, images are also automatically removed from Cloudinary

### 3️⃣ Database — Neon PostgreSQL (Cloud)

- Database is hosted on **Neon** (free tier) — a serverless PostgreSQL platform
- Data is accessible from **any machine** without local setup
- Hibernate auto-creates and manages tables via `ddl-auto=update`
- New columns/tables (rental types, bookings) use `columnDefinition` defaults so schema migrations backfill existing rows safely instead of failing on `NOT NULL` constraints

### 4️⃣ Rental Types & Booking System

Each property can independently offer **Monthly rent, Daily rent, or both**, each with its own price (`monthlyRent`, `dailyRent`, `availableMonthly`, `availableDaily`).

**Booking workflow (owner-approval model):**

- A student picks dates on the property page and submits a **booking request**, which is created with status `PENDING`
- The request already blocks those dates for other students — a property is occupied by at most one active booking (monthly or daily) at a time, regardless of type, so two people can never be approved into overlapping dates
- The **owner** reviews requests on their property's Bookings page and **Approves** (→ `CONFIRMED`) or **Rejects** (→ `CANCELLED`) each one
- A red, pulsing **notification badge** on the owner's My Properties dashboard shows the pending-request count per property
- Students track all their requests on **My Bookings**, split into Monthly and Daily sections, and can **withdraw** a request while it's still pending (not once it's confirmed)

**Calendar UI — different behavior per rental type:**

- **Daily** bookings: click a start day and an end day on a custom calendar widget; booked/past days are greyed out and unclickable
- **Monthly** bookings: click a single move-in date, then choose a duration (1/2/3/6/12 months) from a dropdown — the move-out date is computed automatically (handling month-length edge cases) and checked against existing bookings
- Dates are formatted in local time throughout (never converted through UTC), avoiding the off-by-one-day bugs that timezone-naive date handling commonly introduces

### 5️⃣ Location-Based Property Search

The platform features a **smart two-mode search system**:

**Mode 1 — Manual Search**

- Student enters city/area name, optional max rent, and optional **rental type filter** (Monthly only / Daily only / Any)
- Searches both `city` and `area` fields (case-insensitive, partial match)
- e.g. searching "Salbari" matches a property with `area="Salbari"` even if `city="Sukna"`

**Mode 2 — Find Near Me (GPS)**

- Student clicks "Find Near Me" — browser requests location permission
- Student can choose search radius: 2 / 5 / 10 / 20 km
- **Step 1 (GPS):** Haversine formula query finds properties with stored coordinates within the chosen radius, sorted by distance
- **Step 2 (Fallback):** If no GPS results, reverse geocoding via Nominatim converts the student's coordinates to a city/area name, then falls back to text-based matching
- This ensures results are always returned even when properties don't have GPS coordinates yet

**Auto-Geocoding on Property Save**

- When an owner saves a property, `GeoCodingService` automatically calls the Nominatim API to convert `city + area` into `latitude` + `longitude`
- Coordinates are stored silently — owners never need to enter GPS data manually
- As more properties are saved, GPS-based search coverage improves automatically

### 6️⃣ Error Handling

- Custom `/access-denied` page for 403 Forbidden errors
- Custom themed **"Unauthorized"** page for ownership-mismatch actions (e.g. editing another owner's property)
- Custom `error-page.html` for general exceptions (e.g., user not found)

### 7️⃣ Responsive UI

- Bootstrap 5 used for responsiveness
- Navbar buttons collapse into a dropdown on smaller screens
- Dark/light theme toggle on every page, synced via `localStorage`
- The booking calendar adapts its layout for mobile; dashboard cards reflow from a grid to a row layout on small screens
